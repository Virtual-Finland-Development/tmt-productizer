# tmt-productizer
Test implementation for ty√∂markkinatori productizer. Actual API is not yet released, so we have to mock the data.

### Generating models from Open API spec

Execute `generate-api-models.sh` shell script in terminal

### Mocking data with Prism

#### Install Prism
`npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli`

#### Run Prism
Run the following command in `openapi` directory:

`prism mock TMT.yaml`

If you wish to generate dynamic data, use `--dynamic` flag with the previous command.

### Running productizer locally

Start up Prism mock server and take note of the port it is using (4010 by default). Open `appsettings.Development.json` and
make sure `TmtOptions:ApiEndpoint` host and port are matching that of Prism mock server. 
To query job data send POST request with correct body to `http://localhost:5286/jobs`

Alternatively you can run both prism and productizer with Docker compose command

`docker  compose up`

Note: Prism doesn't seem to work in docker container if host machine is M1 Mac :(
